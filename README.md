### _Toy Model Implementation of the Piston Ball Multi-Agent Problem_

> [Report](https://github.com/OJL96/Piston-Ball-Toy-Model/files/7219483/20316736_PHYS4037.pdf) (Warning! Its long. Please refer to Chapter 4 and beyond for details about new proposed methodology)  

> Toy Model 1.0 
* Binary states

> Toy Model 2.0
* Multi-value states
* Agent states can only deviate by 1

> Toy Model 2.1
* Ball can now take position in between pistons

> Toy Model 2.2
* Backward motion added
* Random ball rolling added when neighbouring pistons are less than the piston that holds the ball
